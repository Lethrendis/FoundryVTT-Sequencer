# Version 3.4.1
- *Effects* - Fixed effects with internal loops not playing & looping correctly (thanks Codas!)
- *Effects* - Tweaked just-in-time spritesheet generation to not scale resulting spritesheets as much (thanks Codas!) 

# Version 3.4.0
- *Sequencer* - Added support for custom FPS for flipbooks through an `_fps` database tag
- *Sequencer* - Added support for spritesheet type effects through linking the spritesheet `.json` manifest in the database
- *Sequencer* - Added a just-in-time compiler to transform webm video-based effects to gpu-optimized spritesheets
  - This greatly improves performance when many instances of the same persisted effects are playing at once
  - Persisted effects are automatically transformed to spritesheets in background threads. Once the compiled spritesheets are available, video effects are seamlessly replaced with spritesheets, greatly reducing the overhead for video decoding for those effects. Depending on size of the effect, spritesheet generation is expected to take anywhere from 5 seconds to 90 seconds. The size of generated Spritesheet textures is limited to 8192x8192px to maximize compatibility and limit memory usage
  - Generated spritesheets are cached client-side in a semi-persistent, file-based browser cache
  - Spritesheet generation for video files is only supported in trusted contexts (meaning https or hosted and connected locally on the same machine). This is a hard limitation by the browser vendors and not expected to be lifted in the future
- *Sequencer* - Tweaked `Sequencer.Presets.get()` to support fall-backs to lower-complexity named entries
  - If you have added a preset named `spell.ranged` and attempt to get a non-existent `spell.ranged.fire`, it will return the `spell.ranged` entry as a fallback
  - You can enable the previous behavior by passing `true` as a secondary argument, which causes the method to require an exact match
- *Crosshairs* - Added `displayRangePoly` to `.location()` and the `Sequencer.Crosshair.show()` API
- *Crosshairs* - Fixed some minor crosshair issues surrounding utilizing them for effects
- *Crosshairs* - Fixed `Sequencer.Crosshair.collect()` not working correctly with some crosshair shapes
- *Effects* - Fixed flipbook animations framerate being tied to canvas FPS
- *Effects* - Fixed offset from `.rotateTowards()` applying to the source location instead of the target
- *Effects* - Fixed effects with added text and `.rotateTowards()` having their anchor point moved to an unexpected location
- *Effects* - Fixed persisted `.stretchTo()` effects not correctly looping the effect in certain cases
- *Effects* - Fixed `.loopOptions()` not working correctly for persisted effects when combined with `.timeRange()`
- *Effects* - Fixed `.scaleOut()` end value being multiplied by a potentially set `.scaleIn()` value.
  - `scaleIn(0.25).scaleOut(2)` now scales the effect in from 0.25 to 1. Plays the animation at 1x size and then scales the animation out to 2x default animation size. Previously, the animation would scale out to 0.5x the default effect size.
- *Effects* - Fixed `attachTo()` not working on in-flight crosshairs

Big thanks to Codas for his incredible work on the just-in-time compiler, general optimizations, and many fixes! Please support him at the following link: <https://ko-fi.com/Codas>

- *Effects* - Fixed being able to pass non-valid parameters to `.atLocation()` and similar functions without errors

### Version 2.4.4
- *Sequencer* - Tweaked the arguments to `new Sequence("moduleName")` to `new Sequence(inOptions)` - it now takes a single object that can contain:
  - `moduleName` <string> - The name of the module that is creating this sequence - this is for other users to know which module used Sequencer
  - `softFail` <boolean> - Setting this to `true` causes any failures to find files for effects, sounds, or macros to softly fail, rather than halt the entire sequence
- *Effects* - Tweaked `.shape()`s parent to be the `spriteContainer` rather than the `sprite`, so that animations to the sprite doesn't affect the shapes
- *Effects* - Fixed `.shape()` not considering their offset with `isMask` enabled

- *Sequencer* - Added support for persistent visual effects on "fake" tokens created by Multilevel Tokens (only supports effects that are applied to the prototype token) 
- *Sequencer* - Slightly improved the speed of document updates when visual effects are first applied
- *Sequencer* - Added a throttled console warning when the Photosensitive Mode is enabled and a client is trying to play effects (only warns once every 10 seconds when effects are played)

- *Sequencer* - Added full support for Sequencer typings in the ***Monaco Macro Editor*** (thanks to laquasicinque for your initial work!)
- *Sequencer* - Changed all settings to use Foundry v10's `requiresReload` instead of reloading the app
- *Sequencer* - Removed compendium of sample macros, in favor of the new wiki
- *Effects* - Added further support for webm's loaded through S3 buckets (files with type `application/octet-stream` now supported)
- *Sounds* - Sounds' `.file()` now has a secondary parameter to allow a false-y primary input to soft fail, instead of halting the entire Sequence

### Version 2.3.18
- *Sequencer* - Added support for Foundry's photosensitive setting, which disables all effects without impacting other functionality 
- *Sequencer* - Fixed incompatibility with the Foundry team's ***A House Divided*** adventure, the scenes should no longer appear to have a dark overlay

- *Effects* - Fixed `.missed()` and `.stretchTo()`'s `randomOffset` having weird interactions when `.name()` was used to play effects at target locations
- *Effects* - Fixed `.tieToDocuments()` throwing errors and not removing effects when the tied documents were deleted 

### Version 2.3.11
- *Sequencer* - Added `Sequencer.Database.inverseFlattenedEntries` which is a map object with the key being the file path and the value being the database path for that file
- *Effects* - Added `bindElevation` (default `true`) as a secondary argument to `.attachTo()` which can be used to make effects not follow the target's elevation
- *Effects* - Made `.elevation()` be relative to the target of the effect by default, you can pass a secondary object with `absolute: true` to make it absolutely elevated on the scene
- *Effects* - Improved internal logic when trying to play effects on clients who have disabled them - previously it had a chance to throw an error when clients with effects disabled would run sequences that included effects (as they would not know the duration of the effect)

- *Effects* - Fully removed deprecated methods: `.addPostOverride()`, `.reachTowards()`, `.gridSize()`, `.startPoint()`, `.endPoint()`

### Version 2.2.4
- *Effects* - Fixed `.rotateTowards()`'s `rotationOffset` parameter not working properly
-

- *Effects* - Fixed `.loopProperty()` with property `scale` would incorrectly scale effect
- 
### Version 2.2.0 (last V9 update, except maybe some bug fixes)
**Additions:**
- *Effects* - Added `.tieToDocuments()` which allows you to tie an effect to Foundry documents - such as Active Effects or Tokens. When these are deleted, the effect is automatically ended.
- *Effects* - Added secondary `offset` parameter to `.atLocation()`, `.attachTo()`, `.rotateTowards()`, `.from()`, and `.stretchTo()` which can be used to offset the location of the source or target
  - Note: This means that `.offset()` is becoming deprecated - it will remain for a few versions with a silent warning
- *Effects* - Added `.spriteScale()` which can be used to scale the sprite of the effect separately from `.scale()`

**Tweaks:**
- *Animations* - Renamed `.rotateTowards()`'s secondary parameter's `offset` property to be more accurately named `rotationOffset`
- *Effects* - Upgraded `.animateProperty()` and `.loopProperty()` to be additive, which means two animations can now target the same property on the same effect
- *Effects* - Renamed `.rotateTowards()`'s secondary parameter's `offset` property to be more accurately named `rotationOffset`

**Fixes:**
- *Sequencer* - Fixed issue where copying the file path of a Database entry that has multiple ranges would always copy the file path for the middle-most range
- *Sequencer* - Rewrote the database traversal method to be more robust and carry metadata down to lower children
- *Effects* - Fixed long-running issue with lag and performance impact from Sequencer on some computers - the cause was the `.screenSpace()` layers, which have now been reworked. A setting to disable the Above UI Screenspace effects layer has been added to further support impacted individuals.
- *Effects* - Fixed `randomOffset` secondary option on `.attachTo()` not working
- *Effects* - Fixed `.scaleToObject()` and `.scale()` not playing nicely together

- *Sequencer* - Removed stray `console.log`
- *Sequencer* - Fixed Ouija board macro error, slightly improved effect positioning

### Version 2.1.12
- *Effects* - Fixed `.strechTo()` with parameter `attachTo: true` resulting in no stretching

### Version 2.1.11
- *Effects* - Fixed effects attached to temporary templates causing errors in core Foundry code

  - Note that if an effect is attached to an object via `.attachTo()`, you may need to disable `bindVisibilty` if the object is hidden
- *Effects* - Fixed `.from()`, it now uses the object's image when the effect plays, rather than when the Sequence was first created
- *Effects* - Fixed highlight box when hovering over effects in the Effect Manager UI not taking effect rotation into account
- *Effects* - Fixed effects sometimes not fully following its attached object 

### Version 2.1.0
**Additions:**
- *Sequencer* - Added support for the Effect Manager to be able to manipulate effects on other scenes, which means you can now end effects on other scenes than the one you're on via the API

- *Effects* - Added options parameter to `.scaleToObject()`, which can be passed `uniform: true` to cause the scaling to always be uniform (it picks the largest dimension of the object)
- *Macros* - Added the ability to reference compendiums when creating `.macro()`s in sequences

**Fixes:**

**Breaking changes:**
- *Sequencer* - Sequencer now requires the `socketlib` module
- *Sequencer* - All existing persistent effects created using 1.X.X Sequencer will be updated to the 2.0.0 system, but it's nigh impossible to catch all the edge cases, so please report any strangeness!
- *Effects* - Removed support for audio methods on effects (hardly used and caused a whole host of problems)
- *Effects* - Deprecated `.reachTowards()` and renamed it to `.stretchTo()`. The deprecated method will be removed in 2.1.0.

- *Effects* - Removed deprecated method `.JB2A()`

**Tweaks:**
- *Sounds & Effects* - Tweaked `.forUsers()` to also accept player names (case-sensitive) instead of just IDs
- *Effects* - Tweaked attached effects' layer handling - effects can now be attached but exist below _all_ Tokens, for example
- *Effects* - Tweaked `.filter()` to allow being called multiple times, which now layers the filters in the order they were created

**Additions:**
- *Sequencer* - Added selection tool to the Effect Layer - select, move, reattach, and delete effects on the canvas!

- *Sequencer* - Added support to filter for `source` and `target` in the Effect Manager's API (such as `getEffects`, `endEffects`, etc)
- *Sequencer* - Added "private" boolean flag to `Sequencer.Database.registerEntries()` which causes the entries to not be visible in the Database Viewer and Effect Player
- *Sequencer* - Added Setting to be able to hide Sequencer's tools on the toolbar
- *Sequencer* - Added checkbox to Database Viewer to show all ranges of a single effect, which is by default set to false

- *Animations* - Added `.hide()` and `.show()` to hide or show the animated object
- *Effects* - Added more secondary options parameters to `.stretchTo()`, which accepts:
    - At long last, this can now `attachTo` (boolean) to the given target. Combine with `.attachTo()` to link an effect between two tokens!
    - `onlyX` (boolean), if set to true, this will cause stretchTo to only stretch the X axis of the sprite towards the target (keeping Y at 1.0, or your given scale)
- *Effects* - Added support to `.file()` for an object map containing the feet range and filepath key-value pair. Check out the file wiki entry to understand what this means: https://github.com/fantasycalendar/FoundryVTT-Sequencer/wiki/Effects#file
- *Effects* - Added secondary options parameter to `.attachTo()`, which accepts:
    - `align` (string, default "center"), accepts `top-left`, `center`, `left`, `bottom-right`, etc. Read the wiki: https://github.com/fantasycalendar/FoundryVTT-Sequencer/wiki/Effects#attach-to
    - `bindVisibility` (boolean, default true), if set to false, the effect will not be hidden if the attached object is hidden
    - `bindAlpha` (boolean, default true), if set to false, the effect's alpha will be independent of the attached object
    - `followRotation` (boolean, default true), if set to false, the effect will not follow the rotation of the attached object
- *Effects* - Added options to `.size()` which allows for `{ gridUnits: true }` - this makes the size given to the method scale to the scene's grid, instead of setting the exact width and height
- *Effects* - Added the same option as above to `.animateProperty()` and `.loopProperty()`, which only works if you animate the `width` or `height`

**Fixes:**

- *Effects* - Fixed major issue with the way effects that were using `.missed()` and `.name()` were cached
- *Sequencer* - Removed stray debug code

### Version 0.3.6
- *Effects* - Added `.fadeIn()` and `.fadeOut()` - you can now make your effects look slightly nicer!
- *Effects* - Added support for cone and line templates with `.reachTowards()` and `.rotateTowards()` - it now reaches towards the end point of the template
- *Effects* - Added `.name()` to effects - this will cause the effect's position to be stored and can then be used with `.atLocation()`, `.reachTowards()`, and `.rotateTowards()` to refer to previous effects' locations
    - Example: naming an impact effect with `.name("hit_location")` and making it miss with `.missed()`, and then have a subsequent effect use `.rotateTowards("hit_location")` to rotate towards the previous effect's calculated location
- *Effects* - Fixed `.scale()` bug that caused it to not properly set the scale and then cause an error upon calling `.play()`
- *Effects* - Removed `.moves()` for future implementation
- *Sequencer* - Tweaked `.async()` and `.waitUntilFinished()` handling
    - They now act the same on effect and sounds that only play once, but if it `.repeats()`, `.async()` causes the effect or sound to wait between each repetition, `.waitUntilFinished()` causes the sequencer to wait until the effect or sound has finished executing all of its repetitions, which may or may not wait for each effect or sound to play with `.async()`
- *Sequencer* - Calling `.play()` now returns the sequence
- *Sequencer* - Removed `FXMaster` dependency and implemented a custom canvas layer and effects class

### Version 0.3.5 Hotfix
- *Sequencer* - Fixed `.wait()` breaking due to the `.async()` and `.waitUntilFinished()` swap

### Version 0.3.4 Hotfix
- *Effects* - Fixed issue that caused the wrong scale to be applied when using `.reachTowards()`

### Version 0.3.3
- *Effects* - Added `.playIf()` ([docs](https://github.com/fantasycalendar/FoundryVTT-Sequencer/wiki#play-if)); this allows you to completely ignore playing an effect or sound, depending on a boolean or a function
- *Sounds* - Added support for `.async()` and `.waitUntilFinished()` for sounds - requires both to be `true` due to code weirdness, I'll be refactoring this in the future
- *Effects* - Refactored `.scale()` when it was provided with a minimum and maximum value, it now randomizes the scale of the effect when executed instead of when the method was called
- *Effects & Sounds* - Refactored `.file()` for both effects and sounds so that providing an array of files no longer immediately picks one from the array, but randomly picks a file each time the section is executed
- *Effects & Sounds* - Refactored how `.delay()` interacted with `.repeats()`, which should result in more consistent behavior
- *Sequencer* - Swapped the functionality of `.async()` and `.waitUntilFinished()`, and clarified in the docs
- *Sequencer* - Added support for random range within a `.wait()` block (like, `.wait(500, 1000)` etc)

### Version 0.3.2 - 0.8.x ready!
* *Effects* - Added `.playbackRate()` to effects, you can now speed up the play rate of your effects
* *Sequencer* - Tweaked internal handling of `.async()` together with `.waitUntilFinished()` improved
* *Sequencer* - Tweaked to use `ready` instead of `init` to load module

### Version 0.3.1
- *Effects* - Refactored `.randomizeMirror()` into `.randomizeMirrorX()` and `.randomizeMirrorY()`
- *Effects* - Refactored scaling algorithm for `.reachTowards()`
- *Sequencer* - Added support for random `.wait()` interval

### Version 0.3.0
- *Effects* - Refactored `.aimTowards()` into `.rotateTowards()` and `.reachTowards()`
- *Effects* - Refactored how `.missed()` chooses the location to hit and now takes token size into account
- *Effects* - Added `.JB2A()` to automatically set the effect to handle their sprites in the best way possible
- *Effects* - Added `.randomizeMirror()` to randomly mirror sprites on the Y axis
- *Effects* - Added Mustache support in file names

### Version 0.2.0
- *Sequencer* - Added support for executing macros
- *Sequencer* - Added support for playing sounds
- *Sequencer* - Wrapped classes in proxies to simplify fluid interface (gets rid of `.done()` on effects and sounds)

### Version 0.1.0
- First implementation
