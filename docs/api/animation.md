# Animation

### What is this?

This part of the Sequencer acts **on** objects in the scene, such as tokens, tiles, etc, and it can do things like moving tokens, teleporting them, hiding them, fading them out, etc.

### How do I use this?

When creating an animation section, you can assemble these methods like this:
```js
new Sequence()
    .animation()
        .on(token)
        .fadeIn(500)
        .teleportTo({ x: 100, y: 0 })
    .play()
```

## Wait Until Finished

`.waitUntilFinished()` or `.waitUntilFinished(-500)` or `.waitUntilFinished(0, 250)`

Calling this method will cause the section to finish running before starting the next section.

Passing a number as a parameter will cause the effect or sound to wait for the given number (in ms) after finishing playing before continuing to the next section.

If given a negative number, the Sequencer will continue to the next section early but continue playing the animation.

Passing a second number will randomize the wait duration between the two given numbers.

## Async

`.async()`

Calling this will make each part of a section finish playing before the next one starts playing.

This differs from `.waitUntilFinished()` in the sense that `.async()` is for each repetition (see `.repeats()` below), whilst `.waitUntilFinished()` is for the entire section.

## Repeats

`.repeats(inRepetitions, inRepeatDelayMin, inRepeatDelayMax)`

Causes the effect or sound to be repeated `inRepetitions` times, with an optional delay.

As an option, you can give it `inRepeatDelayMin` for a static delay between repetitions, or `inRepeatDelayMin` and `inRepeatDelayMax` for a random delay between each call.

It is highly recommended that you do not load too many files at the same time, as Foundry might not be able to load all of them.

## Play if

`.playIf(truthy|falsey)` or `.playIf(inBool)` or `.playIf(inFunction)`

Causes the section not play, and skip all delays, repetitions, waits, etc. If you pass a function, the function should return something false-y if you do not want the effect or sound to play.

Below is an example of a function used in this method, which would cause this effect or sound to only be played about 50% of the time.
```js
.playIf(() => {
	return Math.random() < 0.5;
})
```

## Delay

`.delay(1000)` or `.delay(500, 1000)`

This will delay the section from being played for a set amount of milliseconds. If given a second number, a random delay between the two numbers will be generated.

## Preset

`.preset("name")`

Applies a preset to the current animation - read the [Sequencer Presets article](presets.md) for more information.

## Opacity

`.opacity(0.5)`

Sets the opacity of the animation target. If used with `.fadeIn()` and/or `.fadeOut()`, this defines what it will fade to/from.

## Fade in

`.fadeIn(duration, options)`

`.fadeIn(500)` or `.fadeIn(250, { ease: "easeOutQuint" })` or `.fadeIn(400, { ease: "easeOutCirc", delay: 100 })`

Causes the animation target to fade in its opacity/alpha when played.

A second options parameter can set the ease of the fade, and the delay before it starts.

Default parameters: `{ ease: "linear", delay: 0 }`

**Note:** The `ease` parameters are _not_ supported for tokens due to Foundry removing support for it.

## Fade out

`.fadeOut(duration, options)`

`.fadeOut(500)` or `.fadeOut(250, { ease: "easeOutQuint" })` or `.fadeOut(400, { ease: "easeOutCirc", delay: -100 })`

Causes the animation target to fade out its opacity/alpha when it has finished playing.

A second options parameter can set the ease of the fade, and a delay before it ends. E.g. a delay of -500 means the fade will finish 500ms before the end.

Default parameters: `{ ease: "linear", delay: 0 }`

**Note:** The `ease` parameters are _not_ supported for tokens due to Foundry removing support for it.

## Duration

`.duration(500)`

Sets the duration of the animation, which determines how long the animation will take to complete.

**Note:** This method _not_ supported for tokens due to Foundry removing support for it.

## Volume

`.volume(0.5)`

A normalized value between `0.0` and `1.0` which determines the volume of the sound. Defaults to `0.0`.

**Note:** This is affected by each client's volume settings in Foundry, so if you or your users cannot hear the sound, double check your Interface Volume.

## Fade In Audio

`.fadeInAudio(duration, options)`

`.fadeInAudio(500)` or `.fadeInAudio(250, { ease: "easeOutQuint" })` or `.fadeInAudio(400, { ease: "easeOutCirc", delay: 100 })`

Causes the audio on the given section fade in when played.

A second options parameter can set the ease of the fade, and the delay before it starts.

Default parameters: `{ ease: "linear", delay: 0 }`

## Fade Out Audio

`.fadeOutAudio(duration, options)`

`.fadeOutAudio(500)` or `.fadeOutAudio(250, { ease: "easeOutQuint" })` or `.fadeOutAudio(400, { ease: "easeOutCirc", delay: -100 })`

Causes the section to fade out its audio as it finishes playing.

A second options parameter can set the ease of the fade, and a delay before it ends. E.g. a delay of -500 means the fade will finish 500ms before the end.

Default parameters: `{ ease: "linear", delay: 0 }`

## On

`.on(inToken)` or `.on(inTile)`

## Move Towards

`.moveTowards(target, options)`

`.moveTowards(inToken)` or `.moveTowards(inTile)` or `.moveTowards({ x: 0, y: 0 })`

Sets the location to move the target object to over the course of the duration.

If no duration has been set, the target object will move towards the location at the default foundry speed.

A second options parameter can set the ease of the movement, the delay before it starts, and whether the object should be centered on the given location.

**Note:** The `ease` parameter _not_ supported for tokens due to Foundry removing support for it.

Default parameters: `{ ease: "linear", delay: 0, relativeToCenter: false }`

`.rotateTowards(target, options)`

`.rotateTowards(inToken)` or `.rotateTowards(inTile)` or `.rotateTowards({ x: 0, y: 0 })`

A second options parameter can set the duration of the rotation (0 is instant), the ease, the delay before it starts, and any given rotation offset.

Default parameters:
```js
{
    duration: 0,
    ease: "linear",
    delay: 0,
    rotationOffset: 0,
    towardsCenter: true,
